# 1. Age of maturity. Please write a program which asks the user for their age. The program should then print out a message based on whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity. Answer:

age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age > 18:
    print("You are of age!")

else:
    print("You are not of age!")
    
# 2. Greater than or equal to. Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater. If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message. Answer:

first_number = int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
another_number = int(input("Please type in another number: "))

if first_number > another_number:
    print("The greater number was:", first_number)

elif first_number < another_number:
    print("The greater number was:", another_number)

elif first_number == another_number:
    print("The numbers are equal!")
    
# 3. Please write a program which asks for the names and ages of two persons. The program should then print out the name of the elder.

first_person = input("What is your name? ")

first_person_age = int(input("What is your age? "))

second_person = input("What is your name? ")

second_person_age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if first_person_age > second_person_age:
    print("The elder is", first_person)

elif first_person_age < second_person_age:
    print("The elder is", second_person)

elif first_person_age == second_person_age:
    print(first_person, "and", second_person, "are the same age")
    
# 4. Please write a program which asks the user for two words. The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last. Answer:

first_word = input("Please type in the 1st word: ")
second_word = input("Please type in the 2nd word: ")

if first_word > second_word:
    print(f"{first_word} comes alphabetically last")

elif second_word > first_word:
    print(f"{second_word} comes alphabetically last")

else:
    print("You gave the same word twice")

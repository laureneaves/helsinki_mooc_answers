# 1. This program should print out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user inputs "no". Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish. Answer:

while True:
    print("hi")
    greet = input("Shall we continue?")
    if greet == "no":
        print("okay then")
        break

# 2. Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers. If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "Invalid number". If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python sqrt function. In either case, the program should then ask for another number. If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and exit the loop. Answer:

from math import sqrt

while True:
    num = int(input("Please type in a number: "))
    if num < 0:
        print("Invalid number")

    elif num == 0:
        print("Exiting...")
        break

    else:
        print(sqrt(num))

# 3. This program should print out a countdown. Answer:

number = 5
print("Countdown!")

while True:
    print (number)
    number = number - 1
    if number == 0:
        break

print("Now!")

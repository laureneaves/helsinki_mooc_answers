# 1. This program should print out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user inputs "no". Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish. Answer:

while True:
    print("hi")
    greet = input("Shall we continue?")
    if greet == "no":
        print("okay then")
        break

# 2. Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers. If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "Invalid number". If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python sqrt function. In either case, the program should then ask for another number. If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and exit the loop. Answer:

from math import sqrt

while True:
    num = int(input("Please type in a number: "))
    if num < 0:
        print("Invalid number")

    elif num == 0:
        print("Exiting...")
        break

    else:
        print(sqrt(num))

# 3. This program should print out a countdown. Answer:

number = 5
print("Countdown!")

while True:
    print (number)
    number = number - 1
    if number == 0:
        break

print("Now!")

# 4. Write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes. PIN and number of attempts. Answer:

attempts = 1
while True:
    pin = input("PIN: ")
    if pin == "4321":
        break
    print("Wrong")
    attempts += 1
 
if attempts == 1:
    print("Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
else:
    print(f"Correct! It took you {attempts} attempts")
    
# 5. Please write a program which keeps asking the user for words. If the user types in end, the program should print out the story the words formed, and finish. Answer:

story = ""
previous = ""
while True:
    word = input("Please type in a word: ")
    if word == "end" or word == previous:
        break
    story += word + " "
    previous = word
 
print(story)

# 6. Program asks for integer numbers. It prints out how many numbers were typed in.  It prints out the sum of all numbers typed in. It prints out the mean of the numbers. 0 isn't included in this. It prints out statistics on how many numbers were positive and how many were negative. Answer:

print("Please type in integer numbers. Type in 0 to finish.")
numbers = 0
sum = 0
positives = 0
 
while True:
    number = int(input("Number: "))
    if number == 0:
        break
    numbers += 1
    sum += number
    if number>0:
        positives += 1
 
print("Numbers typed in", numbers)
print("The sum of the numbers is", sum)
print("The mean of the numbers is", sum/numbers)
print("Positive numbers", positives)
print("Negative numbers", numbers-positives)
